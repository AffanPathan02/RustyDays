# Bare-Metal Operating System Kernel Development

## Overview

When writing an operating system kernel, especially for a "bare-metal" environment, the code should be self-contained and not rely on any external libraries or features provided by an existing operating system. This documentation outlines key principles and considerations for developing a bare-metal operating system kernel.

# Building a Bare-Metal Operating System Kernel

Imagine building a house from scratch, creating the core foundation without any pre-made tools or structures. That's a bit like crafting a bare-metal operating system kernel – the essential software that runs directly on computer hardware without relying on an existing operating system.

## What Does It Involve?

### No Handy Toolkit

You won't have access to the usual libraries and features provided by operating systems. It's like having to build your own toolbox for memory management, string handling, and file operations.

### Direct Hardware Communication

Forget about interacting with files and folders. In bare-metal development, you'll work directly with storage devices and other hardware components at a very low level.

### Networking from Scratch

If you want networking capabilities, you'll need to create the entire networking stack, including drivers for network interfaces, without the convenience of pre-built libraries.

### No Console or Terminal

There won't be a ready-made console or terminal. You have to create your own basic input and output methods for interacting with users or displaying debugging information.

### Hardware Know-How

Building a bare-metal kernel involves understanding the hardware intimately – working with the CPU, memory, interrupts, and peripherals directly.

### Bootloader: The Gateway

The bootloader plays a crucial role by loading the kernel into memory and initiating the system. It sets up the initial environment and prepares the hardware for your custom operating system.

### Interrupt Control

Handling interrupts from hardware, like keyboard presses or mouse clicks, is your responsibility. There's no operating system to handle it for you.

## In Essence

Developing a bare-metal kernel is like crafting a custom operating system from the ground up. It's a challenging but rewarding journey for those who want to dive deep into the core of computer systems.
